Used the Phaser game library to create a single player platformer game.

For the game I wanted to achieve a few basic requirements:
1. Have a level with a ground, platforms, and a win/level advancement point
2. Add enemies at various points that moved
3. Have a menu and win screen
4. Have a background sound and sound effects for winning and killing enemies

I was unable to limit player jumping the way I would like.
