Used the Phaser game library and Javascript to create a single player platformer game.

This is a basic platformer game, with the objective being to reach the end to win.

For the game I wanted to achieve a few basic requirements:
1. Have a level with a ground, platforms, and a win/level advancement point
2. Add enemies at various points that moved
3. Have a menu and win screen
4. Have a background sound and sound effects for winning and killing enemies

I was unable to limit player jumping the way I would like.

In a future version I would like to fix/implement a limited jump, add more enemies, make a couple more levels, and implement a shuriken throw to kill the enemies.

To statrt the game you hit the "S" key.
